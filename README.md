# DELTARUNE OST% Tracker Mod
A Deltarune Soundtrack Tracker for your OST% runs !<br>
**NOTE:** This mod is only supported on Chapter 1&2 LTS v3 (1.19) as for now.

# How to install ?
- This mod was only tested on Windows and it's currently unknown if it's supported on Mac. If you have macOS and want to test it, use game.ios instead of data.win in the following steps. Linux is not supported at all because the game_change() function doesn't work;
- Download [the latest](https://github.com/VintagixDev/DELTARUNE_OSTTracker/releases) version of the mod;
- Back up your chapters' vanilla data.win files;
- Use your preferred ROM Patcher to apply the patches to each of the vanilla data.win files. If you don't have any, I recommend using [this one](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) (place the original file in the ROM section and the mod in the Patch section);

# How To Use ?
- After selecting a chapter, the top left of the game will have a list of soundtracks. If the soundtrack is white, it means you haven't listened to it. If it is yellow, it means that you have listened to it.
- Navigate through the soundtracks using the **S <ins>(Previous ST)</ins>** or **D <ins>(Next ST)</ins> keybinds**.
- Toggle the top-left tracker using the **T keybind**.
- Reset the Mod's data using the **"Reset Data"** button on the Chapter 1 file selection screen before each run.
